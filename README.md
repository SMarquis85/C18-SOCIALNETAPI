  ## Description of Assignment

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.jsLinks to an external site. and MongooseLinks to an external site. packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

  ## About 

---
### User Story

```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

  ## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to ALL JAVASCRIPT files. To create this assignment, I used Lawrence Wilson's Audiobook. References we're found on Google, multiple websites including W3Schools, DEV, GitHub, Insomnia and Tutorialspoint. YouTube was helpful as well as all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. I also received the help of my tutor, Erik Hoversten. Erik helped with Insomnia as I needed guidance to created my walkthrough video.
